Imagine you are using a calculator.
You press buttons like +, -, *, /.
These buttons are called operators in programming!

Operators help the computer do things like:

1)Add numbers

2)Compare values

3)Make decisions

##Arithmetic Operators (Math)


+ adds things (5+ 1= 6)

- removes (8- 5 = 3)

 * doubles/triples (3 * 4= 12)

/ divided (6 / 2 = 3).

##Comparison Operators (Check)

These operators ask a question and answer with True or False.


== Are they the same? (3 == 3 → True)

 != Are they different? (5 != 3 → True)

> Is left bigger? (6 > 2 → True)

< Is left smaller? (5 < 8 → True).


##Logical Operators (And / Or / Not)
These are used to combine conditions:

and  both must be true (5 > 2 and 3 > 1 → True)

or  one is enough (5 > 10 or 2 > 1 → True)

 not   flips it! (not False → True)

 ##Conclusion
Operators are like helpers in programming.
They calculate, check, and control what happens in the code.

If you know operators, you are one big step closer to becoming a programmer!✌🏻🔥
